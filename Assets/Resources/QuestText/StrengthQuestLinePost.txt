Boran’s goblin thugs repulsed, you make your way to Boran himself.  With a swing of your mighty sword, you disarm the cyclops! With a final shout, the cyclops turns and runs. Before he flees, he shouts out, “You may have defeated me, but I’ll be back! You’ll never catch me in the Dark Forest!"

No spiders could stop you on your path to find Boran, but just as you think yourself clear, a shadow grows as an enormous white spider rises up before you. Xaga, the Spider Queen! You plunge your sword into her tough carapace and make your way out of the forest. As the leaves part, you see Boran in the distance, running towards the White Mountains.

You battle your way into the chambers of Zorthyr the Dragon, terrible and cruel, the monster that sent a cyclops and his goblin thugs into your village so many weeks ago. Not even the dragon's fiery breath can match your rigorous training as you stab your sword into the beast's heart. At last, this land is finally safe.
