Boran’s goblin thugs repulsed, you make your way to Boran himself. With the last remaining ingredients in your pouch, you tweak the recipe: Cyclops-Be-Gone. A simple spray, and you send the cyclops running. With a final shout, the cyclops turns and runs. Before he flees, he shouts out, “You may have defeated me, but I’ll be back! You’ll never catch me in the Dark Forest!"

Sneaking quietly through the forest, you come upon a trail covered in thick, sticky webbing. Knowing of the evil that dwells here, Xaga the Spider Queen, you loop around to a hidden trail and exit the forest. As the leaves part, you see Boran in the distance, running towards the White Mountains.

You sneak your way into the chambers of Zorthyr the Dragon, terrible and cruel, the monster that sent a cyclops and his goblin thugs into your village so many weeks ago.

This land is finally safe.
